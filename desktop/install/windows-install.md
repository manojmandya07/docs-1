<div id="win-hyper-v" class="tab-pane fade" markdown="1">

### Hyper-V backend and Windows containers

> **Note**
>
> Docker only supports Docker Desktop on Windows for those versions of Windows that are still within [Microsoft’s servicing timeline](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.

Containers and images created with Docker Desktop are shared between all
user accounts on machines where it is installed. This is because all Windows
accounts use the same VM to build and run containers. Note that it is not possible to share containers and images between user accounts when using the Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend.

Running Docker Desktop inside a VMware ESXi or Azure VM is supported for Docker Business customers.
It requires enabling nested virtualization on the hypervisor first.
For more information, see [Running Docker Desktop in a VM or VDI environment](../vm-vdi.md).

### About Windows containers

Looking for information on using Windows containers?

* [Switch between Windows and Linux containers](../faqs/windowsfaqs.md#how-do-i-switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers)
  describes how you can toggle between Linux and Windows containers in Docker Desktop and points you to the tutorial mentioned below.
- [Getting Started with Windows Containers (Lab)](https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/README.md)
  provides a tutorial on how to set up and run Windows containers on Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019. It shows you how to use a MusicStore application
  with Windows containers.
- Docker Container Platform for Windows [articles and blog
  posts](https://www.docker.com/microsoft/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} on the Docker website.

> **Note**
>
> To run Windows containers, you need Windows 10 or Windows 11 Professional or Enterprise edition.
> Windows Home or Education editions will only allow you to run Linux containers.

## Install Docker Desktop on Windows

### Install interactively

1. Double-click **Docker Desktop Installer.exe** to run the installer.

   If you haven't already downloaded the installer (`Docker Desktop Installer.exe`), you can get it from
   [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.
   It typically downloads to your `Downloads` folder, or you can run it from
   the recent downloads bar at the bottom of your web browser.

2. When prompted, ensure the **Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V** option on the Configuration page is selected or not depending on your choice of backend.

   If your system only supports one of the two options, you will not be able to select which backend to use.

3. Follow the instructions on the installation wizard to authorize the installer and proceed with the install.

4. When the installation is successful, click **Close** to complete the installation process.

5. If your admin account is different to your user account, you must add the user to the **docker-users** group. Run **Computer Management** as an **administrator** and navigate to **Local Users and Groups** > **Groups** > **docker-users**. Right-click to add the user to the group.
   Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

### Install from the command line

After downloading **Docker Desktop Installer.exe**, run the following command in a terminal to install Docker Desktop:

```console
$ "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install
```

If you’re using PowerShell you should run it as:

```powershell
Start-Process 'Docker Desktop Installer.exe' -Wait install
```

If using the Windows Command Prompt:

```
start /w "" "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install
```

The `install` command accepts the following flags:

- `--quiet`: suppresses information output when running the installer
- `--accept-license`: accepts the [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} now, rather than requiring it to be accepted when the application is first run
- `--no-windows-containers`: disables Windows containers integration
- `--allowed-org=<org name>`: requires the user to sign in and be part of the specified Docker Hub organization when running the application
- `--backend=<backend name>`: selects the default backend to use for Docker Desktop, `hyper-v`, `windows` or `wsl-2` (default)
- `--installation-dir=<path>`: changes the default installation location (`C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker`)
- `--admin-settings`: automatically creates an `admin-settings.json` file which is used by admins to control certain Docker Desktop settings on client machines within their organization. For more information, see [Settings Management](../hardened-desktop/settings-management/index.md).
  - It must be used together with the `--allowed-org=<org name>` flag. 
  - For example:
    `--allowed-org=<org name> --admin-settings='{"configurationFileVersion": 2, "enhancedContainerIsolation": {"value": true, "locked": false}}'`
- `--proxy-http-mode=<mode>`: sets the HTTP Proxy mode, `system` (default) or `manual`.
- `--override-proxy-http=<URL>`: sets the URL of the HTTP proxy that must be used for outgoing HTTP requests, requires `--proxy-http-mode` to be `manual`.
- `--override-proxy-https=<URL>`: sets the URL of the HTTP proxy that must be used for outgoing HTTPS requests, requires `--proxy-http-mode` to be `manual`.
- `--override-proxy-exclude=<hosts/domains>`: bypasses proxy settings for these hosts and domains, a comma-separated list.

If your admin account is different to your user account, you must add the user to the **docker-users** group:

```console
$ net localgroup docker-users <user> /add
```

## Start Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop does not start automatically after installation. To start Docker Desktop:

1. Search for Docker, and select **Docker Desktop** in the search results.

   ![Search for Docker app](images/docker-app-search.png){:width="300px"}

2. The Docker menu (![whale menu](images/whale-x.svg){: .inline}) displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement window.

   {% include desktop-license-update.md %}

3. Select **Accept** to continue. Docker Desktop starts after you accept the terms.

   Note that Docker Desktop will not run if you do not agree to the terms. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.

   For more information, see [Docker Desktop Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}. We recommend that you also read the [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener" class="*" id="dkr_docs_desktop_install_btl"}.
